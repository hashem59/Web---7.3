As someone who prefers online shopping, I really enjoy using both the Coles and Woolworths
websites. After exploring them closely, I noticed several things that I liked and found helpful:
● Easy-to-use layout: Both websites have a simple and clean structure that’s easy to
follow. Everything is well-organized, which makes browsing comfortable.
● Big, clear search bar: At the top of the page, there’s a large search bar that’s easy to
spot and use. It also gives smart suggestions while typing and remembers past
searches, which saves time.
● Helpful navigation menus: Categories are grouped clearly in drop-downs or side
menus, so you can find what you’re looking for without getting lost.
● Clear product pages: Product pages look neat and are not cluttered. There’s plenty
of space between items, which makes the information easy to read.
● Well-organized details: Things like ingredients, allergy info, and instructions are
shown in a simple, tabbed format. This keeps the page tidy while still giving all the
details when needed.
● Simple fonts: The fonts are easy to read and used consistently across the site, which
gives a clean and professional feel.
● Strong branding and buttons: The use of brand colors is consistent, especially for
important buttons like “Add to Cart,” making them easy to notice and click.
● Minimal animations: Animations are used just a little – enough to make things feel
smooth but not distracting.
● Easy-to-access cart page: Instead of just a small popup cart, there’s a proper cart
page where you can easily review and update your items before checking out.
● Clear delivery options: Information about delivery or click & collect is shown clearly,
which I really appreciated.
● Deals that stand out: Special offers and discounts are highlighted using bright colors
like red or yellow, which helps catch your eye while browsing.
